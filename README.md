# stable_diffusion

This project implements a text-to-image model using stable diffusion, a technique inspired by recent advances in generative modeling. The model takes textual descriptions as input and generates corresponding images. This README file provides an overview of the project, instructions for setup, and usage guidelines.

Overview
The text-to-image model is based on stable diffusion, a method that leverages diffusion models for image generation. The model learns to generate high-quality images from textual descriptions by conditioning the diffusion process on the provided text.

Features
Generate high-quality images from textual descriptions
Utilizes stable diffusion for image generation
Supports various text inputs for diverse image generation

Setup
Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using:
git clone [https://github.com/your/repository.git](https://github.com/girinath18/stable_diffusion/blob/main/Stable_diffusion_model.ipynb)

Install Dependencies: Install the required dependencies by running:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Download Pre-trained Models: Download pre-trained models if available and place them in the appropriate directories.

Usage
Prepare Text Input: Prepare textual descriptions of the images you want to generate.

Run the Model: Execute the model with the prepared text inputs using:
python generate_image.py --text "Your text description here"

Output: The model will generate the corresponding image based on the provided text description.
